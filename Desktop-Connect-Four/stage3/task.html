<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Did you notice any problems with the last stage? If you clicked on a cell in the top row, that cell could be filled while the cells below it were still empty. In the game of Connect Four, pieces are placed by column and then they fall down to rest either on the uppermost game piece in that column or, if it is empty, on theÂ bottom of the board. For this stage, we will defer the logic for placing game pieces in cells to a separate class that can check for the first free cell in each column in which to place a game piece. A click on any cell in the same column should have the same result.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage your program should:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Fill the cells according to availability in the column and not by individual cell clicked on.</li>
    <li>Continue to alternate between "X" and "O" pieces for each click.</li>
</ol>
