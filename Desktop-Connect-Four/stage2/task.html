<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now an empty game board isn't much use if we can't do anything with it. At this stage we will add two important features. The first is allowing the players to place game pieces. In the physical game, they are different colors, but in this desktop version, we will use different letters. We will use the uppercase letters "X" and "O" as the player pieces. The second feature we will add is alternating player turns by click so each person can get a fair chance at winning the game. At this stage, pieces will be placed in the cell where the player clicks and alternate which piece is placed after every click, starting with "X."</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
    <li>First display an empty game board where each cell displays a single space " " as its label.</li>
    <li>When a player clicks on a cell, that cell's label should change to display either "X" or "O" depending on the number of clicks, starting with "X".</li>
</ol>
