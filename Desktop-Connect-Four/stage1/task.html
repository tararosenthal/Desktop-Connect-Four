<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When you want to play a game, the first step is setting up the board! What exactly is a game board? It can be represented in a lot of different ways. For our game of Connect Four, it is a set of rows and columns that intersect each other, forming individual cells that can each store a game piece. The rows and columns help us keep the pieces organized so that we can easily see when a player has linked four in a row. You can see an example&nbsp;below:</p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:100px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>We will use just such a board to play our game. At this stage, we won&#39;t concern ourselves with the pieces&nbsp;but with creating an empty board with nicely aligned rows and columns&nbsp;ready for players to use. We will label these columns by number to make it easier for players to correctly place their pieces later.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:inherit">Objectives</strong></p>

<p>Your program&#39;s output should be an empty game board as described below:</p>

<ol>
    <li>There should be 6 rows and 7 columns for the part of the board where we can place pieces later.</li>
    <li>Use the character &#39;_&#39; in all the cells&nbsp;to create your empty board.</li>
    <li>There should be an additional row on top to label the columns by number from 1-7.</li>
    <li>Put spaces between all numbers and underscore characters.</li>
</ol>
