<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When you want to play a game, the first step is setting up the board! What exactly is a game board? It can be represented in a lot of different ways. For our game of Connect Four, it is a set of rows and columns that intersect each other, forming individual cells that can each store a game piece. The rows and columns help us keep the pieces organized so that we can easily see when a player has linked four in a row. You can see an example&nbsp;below:</p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:100px">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>We will use just such a board to play our game. At this stage, we won&#39;t concern ourselves with the pieces&nbsp;but with creating an empty board with nicely aligned rows and columns&nbsp;ready for players to use. We will label the&nbsp;columns by uppercase&nbsp;letter and the rows by number&nbsp;to make it easier to understand how the board should be organized.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:inherit">Objectives</strong></p>

<p>Your program should display an empty game board as described below:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The main class Connect4 should extend the class JFrame and exit on close.</li>
    <li>The cells should extend the class JButton. (Set focus painted to false to remove highlighting on clicked cells.)</li>
    <li>There should be 6 rows and 7 columns for the cells on the board.</li>
    <li>Each cell should be visible and display its row and column as its label (A1 - G6).</li>
    <li>Each cell should be named Button** where ** designates the same row and column designation as its label.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Organize rows and columns as show in the image below.</li>
</ol>
