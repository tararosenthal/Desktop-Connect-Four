<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, we will implement the final part of the code so that we can have a fully functioning game to play with a friend! To do that, you must write an algorithm to check after each click if either player has connected four pieces in a row. We need to do this in three directions: horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. When a winning move is detected, your program should highlight the four cells so that the players can easily see who has won. To do this, we will have a baseline color for the cells, set as their background, from the start of the game and a separate color for the winning cells. You can choose whichever colors you want for this as long as the baseline color and winning color are different. We also will add a reset button so that we can play the game again without restarting the application. Finally, you should ensure that your program can account for user errors. A click on an already full column should do nothing to the cells and should not change the player turn. Additionally, clicking on any cells in the board after a winner has been found, but before clicking the reset button, should do nothing.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Have a baseline color for all cells at the start of the application.</li>
    <li>Have a reset button that extends JButton named ButtonReset. The button should be enabled.</li>
    <li>Clicking the reset button should clear the text from all cells and return them to their baseline color.</li>
    <li>Check after each move if either player has connected four in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.</li>
    <li>Once a winner has been detected, change the color of the four winning cells to the winning color.</li>
    <li>The baseline color and the winning color should be two different colors.</li>
    <li>Clicking on any cells in an already full column should do nothing and not change player turn.</li>
    <li>Clicking on any cells on the board after a winner has been found, before clicking reset, should do nothing.</li>
</ol>
