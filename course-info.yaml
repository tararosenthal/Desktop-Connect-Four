  About
  Tired of playing Tic-Tac-Toe? Want something a little more challenging? Connect Four is a great game that adds the complexity of a larger game board and the need to line up more pieces. In this project, you will create a version of the game you can run on your computer.

  Learning outcomes
  You will learn about multidimensional arrays, a variety of loops, and taking user input and printing output. You will make your own methods, check your program for errors and exceptions, and write a complicated algorithm to check the board for a winner after each turn.
